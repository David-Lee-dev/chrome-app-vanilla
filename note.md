### Basic of JS

> - Recently, ``var`` is not trend. If possible use ``const`` and use ``let`` sometimes
> - `JS` is for interaction.
> - ``CSS`` if for display.
> - ``querySelector`` and ``getElementById`` are have same role.

### Log in

> - The default action of ``submit`` event is **refresh**
> - It is possible that storing some data in The ``localstorage``.

### Clock

> - usage of ``padStart`` function and ``setInterval``
> - ``setTimeout`` operate only one time.

### Quotes and Background

> - ``Math.random()`` make number **form 0 to 1** randomly

### To Do List

> - Use ``stringify`` to save array in ``local storage`` for use it as string
> - JS provides ``item`` that is being processed
> - The ``foreach`` executes a function for each ``item``
> - When an event is made, I know what it is and where it is. But I can't know that which item of ``local storage`` is the target of event with  without special task.
>   1. Using ``Date.now()``, make a id
>   2. Make an object what have a id and a text
>   3. Add id in ``li.id``
>
> - ``filter`` returns a new array without altering the array.
